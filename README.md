# Movie-Guessing-Game
This is my creation of  project 1 from Udacity's "Object Oriented Programming in Java Course". The rules are simple, the computer randomly picks a movie title, and shows you how many letters it's made up of. Your goal is to try to figure out the movie by guessing one letter at a time.
